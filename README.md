# machinelearninginaction
This is the source code for Machine Learning in Action. All the code is written in Python 3.3. 

I honestly have not thought about how I'd use this repository but it is used as a practise for
Machine Learning, Python and of course using Git. I am still a pretty amateur programmer, very new
to all these technologies and hopefully by June I'd figure my shit out.
